# Songcards

Making digital music collectable again

## What is a Songcard?

A Songcard is a digital music collectable

It contains at least one song and one piece of artwork.

It can unlock access to exclusive content and goodies.

It can have a finite supply and be traded with friends.

It’s a way for artists to sell their music and for fans (we call “Collectors”) to show off their collections to their friends.

Songcards is a new format for releasing music and provides fans a way to support their favourite artists.

## What is a Collector?

A collector is a music superfan.

They are your biggest supporters.

Each Collector will have their own Collectors page.

Here they can show off their Songcard collection and promote your music to their friends

Holders of your Songcards will be the first to know of what's to come.

## How it works

Once you’re set up on the platform, you can start creating your own Songcards.

The Songcards you create will be listed on your artist page.

Your artist page will sit in the link-in-bio, where collectors can listen to your music, browse the Songcards you have to offer, and buy them right there and then!

The Songcard is then featured on their Collector’s page ready to show off to their friends.
